# TimeFlo
Copyright &copy; 2021 Joel Crouch

TimeFlo is an implementation of a
[Pomodoro&reg;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)-like
timer for breaking out of flow state.

This time flow timer will be a Pomodoro style countdown timer.  It will have three "work" intervals, and three "break" intervals.  The timer will allow the user to change the work interval, and the rest interval.  The timer will 
be able to accept varying times, but the work times will not be shorter than 10 
minutes or longer than an hour.  The rest times shall not be shorter than 5 minutes
or longer than an hour.
