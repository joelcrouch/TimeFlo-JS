# The TimeFlo Project: Design
Joel Crouch 2021

## Introduction

This document describes the architecture of this program.

## Architecture
There are css, html, and javascript files.  The HTML file and CSS files describe how the program will look 
like in a chrome browser, and the javascript file describes how the software will work. 

 There will be a "pomodoro" instance where the user may determine the work time 
duration, as well as the rest time duration.  
Threre is only one instance of the program at a time.
Overall:
1. Enter the program
   a.  a timeflo intance is instantiated
   b.  Query for times(work/rest)
2. Finish the pomodoro 4 times.
   a.  Done-Yes->quit.
