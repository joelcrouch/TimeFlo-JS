## Resources

Required resources will be access to gitlab, two dev. machines, knowledge of appropriate language, appropriate code
editor, and time. 

## Work Breakdown

Elicit and write the requirements.  
Determine what language it will be written in-C++, python, javascript/html.
Determine how it should work-write the use cases. 
Code the timer, write tests, as applicable.  Keep the user inputs low, such that there can be fewer points to check for user errors.
Write V&V, and insure testing is as complete as your experience.

These tasks should be completed in a top-down manner, ie get the requirements before you write the V&V.


## Schedule

Week 2:  Finish setting up gitlab on both dev. computers.   
         Finish the plan, and requirements document. 
         Begin to formulate generally how the code should work.
Week 3:  Write and test the code.  
         Begin the V&V.
