## Resources

Required resources will be access to gitlab, two dev. machines, knowledge of appropriate language, appropriate code
editor, and time. 

## Work Breakdown

Elicit and write the requirements.  
Determine what language it will be written in-C++, python, javascript/html.
Determine how it should work-write the use cases. 
Code the timer, write tests, as applicable.  Keep the user inputs low, such that there can be fewer points to check for user errors.
Write V&V, and insure testing is as complete as your experience.

These tasks should be completed in a top-down manner, ie get the requirements before you write the V&V.


## Schedule

Week 2:  Finish setting up gitlab on both dev. computers.   
         Finish the plan, and requirements document. 
         Begin to formulate generally how the code should work.
Week 3:  Write and test the code.   
        Make an HTML timer. 20 minutes
        Make an HTML button for work and rest times. 10 minutes
        Pass that appropriate data to timer. one hour
        Show the time passing on the HTML page.  2 hours
        Test:  Only numbers, and in a range specified.  Use drop down on html page to insure this.
        READ the HTML documentation.  1 -2 hours.
         Begin the V&V.  

## Milestones and Deliverables

The milesstones will depend on the shcedule. 
Milestones for week 2 will be finishing setup, the plan an requirements documents.
Milestone for week 3 will be implementing the code, and devising a V&V/test plan.
Milestone # 4 will be deliverable (read: functional) TimeFlo product.

### *Milestone/Deliverable 1*

Milestone #1 will consist of reading Gitlab documentation, getting the plan and requirements documentation correct.

### *Milestone/Deliverable 2*

Milesstone # 2 will consist of reading the appropriate MDN (Mozilla Dev. Network) documents, and writing a 
HTML, CSS, and JS code to enact the TimeFlo.

### *Milestone/Deliverable 3*

Milestone # 4 will be putting all the doucumentation, and code together and delvering a functional TimeFlo.
