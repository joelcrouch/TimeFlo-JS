definition of a user, a stake holder and a use case. If there are scope
limitations to the project, i.e. things you will not be doing, or are
not required to do, this is a good section to put those.*

## Functional Requirements

The TimeFlo has some requirements that are required for it to work.
It will be a Chrome based browser application, that will show time remaining 
on a countdown timer.  Functioanal requirements are those that are required for it
to work properly.


### *Functional Requirements 1*

Timeflo will have 2 inputs-work and rest times. They will be 
inputted into the timer function in TimeFlo. The timer will countdown 4 times
with the work time, and 3 times with the rest time.  A fourth rest time will be longer 
than the other rests.  In this case, it will be 10 minutes longer than the other rests.


### *Functional Requirement 2*

TimeFlo will have a pause, start and reset buttons.  There must be an alarm of some variety to signal 
an end to a time period.
