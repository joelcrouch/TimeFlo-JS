# The TimeFlo Project: Validation and Verification
Joel Crouch 2021

(*Thanks to Chris Gilmore for the document template for this
document.*)

## Introduction

This is the testing document for TimeFlo.  Testing will involve inspection of the code.

### Purpose and Scope

Developers should read this document.

### Target Audience

Developers should read this document.

### Terms and Definitions

*Define any terms or acronyms you will be using in the remainder of this
document.*

## V&amp;V Plan Description

The code on in main.js will be inspected line by line.  Index.html and style.css will also be inspected.  Refer to MDN
(Mozilla Developer Network) for questions about any functions that are used in the code, or other files. 
## Test Plan Description

Open up the index.html file in a chrome window.  You should be able to add a work phase (5-60 minutes), and a rest phase (5-15 minutes).  The timeflo should execute the work phase 4 times with the same work time, and the rest phase should execute 3 times.  A fourth rest phase will execute, but it will have an additional ten minutes added into the rest phase.

### Scope Of Testing
The test will test the output of the code-ie the chrome page that opens up.  We will not be testing the main.js,
because if the chrome page works, then the code works.


### Testing Schedule

Test every time a change is made.
### Release Criteria

The code will work or it will not.  If the timeflo times (work and rest) operate properly, then the code will be released.


## Unit Testing

*Describe the purpose of this section and outline its contents. Name the
units you will be testing and describe their functionality.*

### Strategy

*Describe the strategy for unit testing of the project. Include items
such as code coverage, differences between unit and integration testing,
excluded code and why it's excluded, etc.*

### Test Cases

*Describe your test cases here.*

## System Testing

*Describe the purpose of this section and outline its contents. Only a
few sentences are expected here.*

### Test Cases

*Describe your test cases here.*

## Inspection

*Describe the strategy for inspection of the
project. Include items such as type of inspection, criteria
for inspection, inspection validation. Add as much detail as
needed here to be clear on what the inspection plan is.*
